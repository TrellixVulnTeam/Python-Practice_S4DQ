We are studying Black Hat python version 2 by Justin Seitz and Tim arnold.

1. Install Kali linux VM & Upgrade
2. Install Python Virtual Environment Python-venv\

That creates a new directory, bhp, in the current directory. We create a 
new virtual environment by calling the venv package with the -m switch and 
the name you want the new environment to have. We’ve called ours venv3, 
but you can use any name you like. The scripts, packages, and Python 
executable for the environment will live in that directory. Next, we activate 
the environment by running the activate script. Notice that the prompt 
changes once the environment is activated. The name of the environment 
is prepended to your usual prompt (venv3 in our case). Later on, when 
you’re ready to exit the environment, use the command deactivate.

3. Installing packages using PIP
